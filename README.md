## About

RecommnedMeAFilm is a small project I made in a few hours as a practice for MongoDB and Routes in ReactJS

User fills the form --> A POST request is made to my MongoDB database --> I can see it in my MongoDB database

I used MongoDB Atlas for connecting MongoDB and Vite for ReactJS as well as Postman and testing

Also tried to go for a digital watch aesthetic for which I used 'digital 7' font and added a little light button at the corner
